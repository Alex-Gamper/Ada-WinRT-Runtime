## Ada-WinRt-Runtime

This project provides a Ada Runtime that can be used with the WinRT bindings and the resulting application
will be deployable on Windows Store. Note the current FSF/GNAT runtime makes use of Windows Api's that are
not compatible with deployment to Windows Store.

Note : this is a work in progress (a formal announcement will be made once complete, and this message will
be removed, so please check back on the status periodically, thanks)
